# SVG Image Tracer

This is a tool for drawing SVGs by tracing over raster images.

## To-Do

### Add CSS with animation to source code copy depending on the value of the animation checkbox

### Consider offsetting all points by .5 to snap the to pixels (using `viewBox` or recalculating them on the fly)

### Add another option to animation delay which would be "after previous" and default to be able to cascade paths

### Add controls for setting `zoom` to different levels

### Add a checkbox for auto closing the current path

### Display a tree of paths and points

### Allow exporting and importing "projects" as JSON files
